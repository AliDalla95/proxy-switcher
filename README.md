Install using the [extensions website](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/771/proxy-switcher/) or alternatively by copying the `ProxySwitcher@flannaghan.com` folder into `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/` and activating the extension in `gnome-tweak-tool`.

Any contributions are very welcome (e.g. new features, translations, bug fixes etc) and I will consider all feature requests. Please submit an issue/pull request or email me at `tomflannaghan@gmail.com`.
